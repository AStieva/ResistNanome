# ResistNanome
A pipeline-tool to easily extract the resistome information of a metagenomic sample sequenced using the Nanopore technique.

This pipeline should be reasonably fast in giving the antibiotic resistance genes present in the metagenomic Nanopore dataset, combined with the bacteria. 
Getting this data is the main objective, but a multitude of tools are build in to improve on the output.
